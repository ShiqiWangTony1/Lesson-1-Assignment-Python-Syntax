# Question 1

# Task 1: Code Correction
# weather = "sunny"
# if weather == "sunny":
#     print("Wear sunglasses!")
# else:
#     print("Take an umbrella")


# Task 2: Your Mood Today
# mood = input("How do you feel today?: ")

# if mood.lower() == "happy":
#     print("That's great to hear!")
# elif mood.lower() == "sad":
#     print("I hope your day gets better!")

# Question 2

# Task 1: Code Correction
# Pi_value = 3.14
# userAge = 25
# user_location = "New York"
# MAXLIMIT = 1000

# PI = 3.14   # Because for constants, we can use all upper case
# user_age = 25   # use snake_case for variable names
# user_location = "New York"  # Good
# MAX_LIMIT = 1000 # Because for constants, we can use all upper case

# Question 3

# Task 1: Grocery Store Math
# water = 1.5
# bread = 3
# beef = 9.75

# total_price = water + bread + beef
# print(f"Total price of water, bread, and beef is ${total_price}")

# Task 2: Bank Interest (Extra Credit)
# initial_amount = 10000
# interest_rate = 0.07
# total_amount = initial_amount * (1+interest_rate)
# print(f"The total amount is ${total_amount}")
